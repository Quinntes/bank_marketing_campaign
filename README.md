</center>

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict potential deposit customers from a bank's telemarketing campaign dataset. By applying machine learning techniques, the goal is to optimize marketing efforts and improve campaign conversions. 

## Business Problem

The marketing team has data from a fixed-term deposit telemarketing campaign. The challenge lies in determining which customers will actually subscribe to the deposit product after receiving the telemarketing offer. Predicting these customers accurately helps optimize telemarketing efforts, avoiding unnecessary costs and maximizing revenue.

### Problem:

The marketing team lacks the ability to identify which customers are most likely to subscribe to the deposit, despite having available data on customer interactions with the bank (e.g., age, job status, account balance).

### Metrics:

#### False Positives (FP):
The model predicts that a customer will subscribe to a deposit, but they do not.

**Consequences:**
- Unnecessary telemarketing calls lead to increased costs.

#### False Negatives (FN):
The model predicts a customer will not subscribe to a deposit, but they do.

**Consequences:**
- Missing potential customers for deposit subscriptions leads to a loss in revenue.

### Cost Comparison:

The cost of contacting customers who are unlikely to subscribe (FP) is lower than the opportunity cost of losing a potential subscriber (FN). Therefore, minimizing FN is prioritized.

### Metric Used:
**Recall:** The primary metric is recall, as it helps detect as many potential deposit customers as possible, avoiding false negatives.

## Data Understanding & Preparation

This section describes the dataset and how it is prepared for modeling.

### 1. Read Dataset
The dataset, containing information on telemarketing campaigns, is loaded from a CSV file.

```python
df = pd.read_csv('data_bank_marketing_campaign.csv')
````

### 2. Data Overview

Initial data exploration to understand the dataset's structure.

```python
df_copy.info()
```

### 3. Feature Selection

Relevant columns are selected for the analysis, including both categorical and numerical features.

```python
df_copy = df_copy[['job', 'housing', 'loan', 'contact', 'month', 'poutcome', 'age', 'balance', 'campaign', 'pdays', 'deposit']]
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is used to understand the relationships and distributions within the data, and to inform model decisions.

---

## Feature Importance Analysis

XGBoost provides feature importance, which indicates which features are most critical for predicting customer subscription behavior.

```python
feature_names = random_search.best_estimator_.named_steps['Preprocessing'].get_feature_names_out()
importances = random_search.best_estimator_.named_steps['model'].feature_importances_
```

## Model Evaluation & Tuning

### 1. Model Comparison

Multiple models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression) are tested. XGBoost performs best in terms of recall, which is essential for identifying potential deposit customers.

### 2. Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameter tuning is done with RandomizedSearchCV to find optimal settings for XGBoost.

## Conclusion & Recommendations

### Conclusion:

* **Feature Importance:** `poutcome_success` and financial stability indicators are key in predicting deposit customers.
* **Recall Prioritization:** Focus on minimizing false negatives is crucial to avoid missing out on potential revenue.

### Recommendations:

1. Focus on customers who participated in successful past campaigns.
2. Optimize telemarketing campaigns during high-conversion months like March and October.
3. Further tune the model to improve recall for deposit customers.

### Future Work:

Further work could explore additional feature engineering and experiment with different models or ensemble methods to improve accuracy.
